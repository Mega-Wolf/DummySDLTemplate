Color Wheel

            WHITE

            YELLOW

    RED               GREEN
--------------------------------- White/Black line
    PURPLE            CYAN

            BLUE

            BLACK

I could also rotate that, so that white is yellow, green, cyan and black is red, purple, blue (that would seem more evil)
However, poison = green is still quite evil

If I want to have poison, then it should be Green
Red sounds like blood, so it should mean cause more damage

This would mean that green and red are just like in GemCraft

They also sound not at all like "white" stuff

Cyan might be ice

Effect ideas:
Poison
Slow Down (Ice)
Mana Steel      ()
Armor reduce
Damage +
Critical Damage (I love the combination ideas with the other things)

Splash Damage (This sounds like a powerup)

White       + Critical Damge (like yellow)
---------------------
Yellow      Mana Steel (like orange) (NOTE: Alternatively something with electricity)
Green       Damage + (like red); 
Cyan        
---------------------    
Blue        Speed - (like blue)
Purple      Armor - (like purple)
Red         Poison(call it bleeding now though) (like green)
---------------------
Black       + Critical Effect

ALTERNATIVE?

Just having critical damage doesn't make for nice combinations

White       + Crits (like yellow, but also critical effect)
---------------------
Yellow      Speed (CONTINUOS) - (like blue) (paralysed)

Green       Armor (ONCE) - (like purple)

Cyan        (ONCE)

---------------------    
Blue        Mana Steal (ONCE) (like orange) (NOTE: Alternatively something with electricity)
                MANA STEAL WHILE TOXIN
Purple      Poison (CONTINUOS) (call it toxic now though) (like green)
                POISON DOES MORE DAMAGE (SINCE WOUNDED)
Red         wounded (CONTINUOS) (like red)
                wounded and slow
---------------------
Black       + Damage + Effects (no this doesn't make a good thing on its own)

---------------------
Yellow      Mana Steal (ONCE) (like orange) (NOTE: Alternatively something with electricity)
                MANA STEAL THE POISON DAMAGE
Green       Poison (CONTINUOS) (like green)
                magic decreases over time (that's quite boring though; alternatively: the magic is "poisoned")
Cyan        Magic (attack etc.) reduction(ONCE) ()
                Also slows down the time magic can be done
---------------------    
Blue        Speed (CONTINUOS) - (like blue) (paralysed)
                Extra Armor reduction during slow
Purple      Armor (ONCE) - (like purple)
                Extra Armor reduction during wounded
Red         wounded (CONTINUOS) (like red)
                wounded steal (super powerfull?)
---------------------
Black       + Damage + Effects (no this doesn't make a good thing on its own)

Ideas for another ONCE effect:
- Effect neutraliser? (But that would make monster effects kind of pointless)
- banishment reducting (also pointless)
- worse pathfinding? (meh)
- crit like in original (meh)

a continuos thing was to attract shot from further away


Color Combinations (only wheel; I think this doesn't make too much sense):

                (O)steal        (O)armor-       (C)speed-                       (C)poison               (C)damage+      
(O)steal        X               x               ?                               steal poison            steal from extra hits
(O)armor-                       X               reduce armor while slow         reduce while poison?    reduce armor a bit while wounded                NOTE(Tobi): the combination with speed- and damage+ are equal
(C)speed-                                       X                               x                       x
(C)poison                                                                       X                       x
(C)damage+                                                                                              X



When I say boost, do I mean damage or effect (but what about 2 symmetric and 3 symmetric then)

2:
- 2 next to each other (-> Boost to both of them)
- 2 with one between (-> That one in the middle gets a little addition?)
- 2 opposite (= 2 between) (-> slight + to damage and effects)
- 2 symmetric (this might overlap with point 1 or three from above)

3:
- 3 next to each other (-> Heavy boost to middle one, slight/normal boost to the outer ones)
- 3 with one apart (point-symmetric, + to damage and effects?)

Additional:
- Only on one site of the black-white line (-> Damage + / Effect +) (But isn't that the bonus of adding white or black already) (I mean, why not both :D)


Note: Opposing colours sounds like -effect/+damage or -damage/+effect but that's kind of weird
-effect/+damage, then the effect combination gets useless
+effect/-damage, then some of the effects don't make that much sense anymore I feel

,also, isn't +effect/-damage already the idea of traps (and you could even make -effect/+damage another building)
