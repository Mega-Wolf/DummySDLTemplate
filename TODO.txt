00000035: ~ 0000-00-00 0.0.0 " xxx "     In-game building; overlays are a bit off
00000036: > 0000-00-00 0.0.0 " xxx "     Separate in-game building from editor stuff (otherwise, this always gets saved as well)
00000037: + 0000-00-00 0.0.0 " xxx "     UI for choosing diamond priority
00000039: + 0000-00-00 0.0.0 " xxx "     Rethink the layout of the right menu, do I really want all that stuff in hexagons; that doesn't look as cool as I thought
00000042: + 0000-00-00 0.0.0 " xxx "     Popups over the buildings and buyable dimaonds to show me their cost + grey out if too expensive
00000044: + 0000-00-00 0.0.0 " xxx "     I somehow want the OpenGL stuff to be pixel perfect; otherwise, some stuff might look really stupid; is that possible
00000050: > 0000-00-00 0.0.0 "OpenGL"     Provide hexes and triangles as those shapes instead of having rect stuff with alpha-cutoffs (I will actually still be able to give the top left point if I want to) - is that even more performant or just useless? For now, I could actually ignore that
00000051: > 0000-00-00 0.0.0 "OpenGL"     Some of the things I do, could use shader arguments (circle or border; however, I don't really have a system as of yet to set such values)
00000052: + 0000-00-00 0.0.0 "OpenGL"     Such a system could also include dynamically having lists of "same" things ("Now, I will have three lists of monster sprites, healthbar stuff, and subsprites" and then I could actually batch these together later on)
00000055: + 0000-00-00 0.0.0 " xxx "     Get rid of the weird and annoying OpenGL depth values again; I have to solve that differently

_____________________ 0.0.1: "Super basic workings" _____________________
00000007: + 0000-00-00 0.0.1 "Sprites"     Dummy Cogwheel sprites (5 different levels for now) (Shall I Do more high-res and just rotate the stuff; or specifically rotated; quite some work)
00000008: + 0000-00-00 0.0.1 "Sprites"     Dummy Cogwheel sprites (support 2 or even three different colours)

_____________________ 0.0.2: "Graphical update" _____________________
00000001: + 0000-00-00 0.0.2 "Sprites"     Swarmling dummy sprites (6 directions)
00000002: + 0000-00-00 0.0.2 "Sprites"     Reaver dummy sprites (6 directions)
00000009: + 0000-00-00 0.0.2 "Backend"     OpenGL port (not sure if this will make some stuff a bit more difficult; somehow make modular)
00000034: + 0000-00-00 0.0.2 "Sprites"     Wall Sprites (at least up and down, but more will be needed in the future for 3d effect)
00000038: + 0000-00-00 0.0.2 "Game"     Better buildings sprites (sprites for wall, tower, trap and future buildings (How do I want to have that arranged))
00000053: + 0000-00-00 0.0.2 "OpenGL"     How do lines work in OGL

_____________________ 0.0.3: "Editors" _____________________
00000012: + 0000-00-00 0.0.3 "Sprites"     Better background sprites (maybe a lot of that will be done via shaders? That would be quite nice; for that I definitely need shader recompile BEFORE (which shouldn't be too difficult); one could create an image out of the shader stuff and then could actually keep that generated image instead of rerendering every frame)
00000013: + 0000-00-00 0.0.3 "Editor"     Level editor (that lets you select deco sprites etc.)
00000014: + 0000-00-00 0.0.3 "Editor"     Monster wave editor
00000017: + 0000-00-00 0.0.3 "Design"     2 boss monsters (spawning swarmlings, destroying walls?, shielded stuff)
00000018: + 0000-00-00 0.0.3 "Design"     Design the first level (visually + waves etc.)
00000031: + 0000-00-00 0.0.3 "Sprites"     New visual version of wave stones (are these cogwheels?)

_____________________ 0.0.4: "World Overview etc." _____________________
00000010: + 0000-00-00 0.0.4 "Design"     2 more buildings (something doing strong attacks and something doing a lot of attacks) (but I think I want another two more)
00000011: + 0000-00-00 0.0.4 "Game"     Wiggle movement of monsters
00000015: + 0000-00-00 0.0.4 "Backend"     World map with level selection
00000016: + 0000-00-00 0.0.4 "Backend"     Actual save games
00000019: + 0000-00-00 0.0.4 "Design"     Design the second level (visually + waves etc.)
00000041: + 0000-00-00 0.0.4 "Sprites"     Think about a world map visualisation (one big thing?; splitted into hexagons? or cogwheels?)

_____________________ 0.0.5: "First deep dive into numbers" _____________________
00000020: + 0000-00-00 0.0.5 "Design"     General Damage output of diamonds + range (+ levelling)
00000021: + 0000-00-00 0.0.5 "Design"     Balance Green
00000022: + 0000-00-00 0.0.5 "Design"     Balance Red

00000025: + 0000-00-00 0.0.5 "Design"     Balance Aqua (I don't really have that much stuff using that at that point, but probably just take the same as purple)
00000026: + 0000-00-00 0.0.5 "Design"     Balance Purple
00000027: + 0000-00-00 0.0.5 "Design"     Balance White
00000028: + 0000-00-00 0.0.5 "Design"     Balance Black

00000030: + 0000-00-00 0.0.5 "Design"     Graph System

_____________________ 0.0.6: "From here on, mainly content" _____________________
00000040: + 0000-00-00 0.0.6 "Design"     Monsters, that use the Magic Stat (several, e.g. inhibiting my towers; providing a shield for others; I want to have a few more)
