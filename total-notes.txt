Since I will separate the lectures, 4b is now Sprites

5a is fonts stuff then
// Since I don't really need all the printing stuff; I don't really need text either
// This however means, that I don't use any sort of printf in the whole series

5b is maybe some diamonds stuff; like drag-drop, buying, merging, leveling them etc.
this would also make the add kills necessary
- drag drop; also consider exchanging when moved on top of something else; the trick is to just keep the diamond position and consider it either left or right depending on their position DONE
- different coloring scheme; I could have a counter for each variable; the problem is that I can't really show the grade of the diamond yet; but this would be trivial with just writing a number
  However; in which colour do I actually show the diamonds? I could easily mix those colours, but am not sure if I want that DONE
- merge; this is basically an extra if in the drag-drop check DONE
- buy DONE
- level up; this should be trivial DONE

- Have things light up for the different actions DONE

- Make the buttons clickable (I think this is not important for now; volunteers can do that)

6a might be same as above; maybe also add effects; monster waves
// No visual effects though; did I mean stuff like poison? That probably seems reasonable

6b music/sound

7 "polish"; disable level editor stuff in final build; show something before start and after end maybe
// I think I do not do that



//TODO(Tobi): I definitely want to add asserts in the code







Series 2:

A lot of focus in sprite stuff/rendering etc.
The problem is, that all this zooming and rotating stuff is not really used in the game and not at all used when using OpenGL etc.
However, one should understand what e.g. MipMaps are
I see both scaling and rotating being used for a few things, so it's not too bad
-> I actually think I should just move all that to the 3d series

Additionally, I want to do some other stuff, that will use these things
- e.g. having a context menu when adding the text rendering
- I want to switch to hexagonal tiles
DONE - Particle effects
DONE - Correct alpha
- Scaling something a bit smaller and 
DONE - Rumble effect, that seems easily achievable with draw_rect (nope, not with draw_rect; whole screen)

Episode 1:
- DrawRect (This needs adjusting of quite some functions + adjusting mouse input and the right menu diamond logic)
- 
- rumble
- Maybe also put the correct alpha stuff here
- Exercise: Maybe rumble is the exercise?

This is by far not enough for a lesson

Episode 2:
- Particle Effects
- Correct alpha for DrawBitmap (bot for the rest though, they are not that important)
- Clean-up either here or in episode before
- Exercise: 

Episode 3:
- Text rendering stuff
- Context menu?
- Exercise:

Episode 4:
- Hexagonal tiles / triangle tiles (This will need several episodes I think)
- Line drawing function DONE
- Drawing hexagons (new sprites)
- New way of storing map data
- Mouse-to-hex mapping
- New Level Editor workings
- Building during the game
- Pathfinding with triangles
