Since I will separate the lectures, 4b is now Sprites

5a is fonts stuff then
// Since I don't really need all the printing stuff; I don't really need text either
// This however means, that I don't use any sort of printf in the whole series

5b is maybe some diamonds stuff; like drag-drop, buying, merging, leveling them etc.
this would also make the add kills necessary
- drag drop; also consider exchanging when moved on top of something else; the trick is to just keep the diamond position and consider it either left or right depending on their position DONE
- different coloring scheme; I could have a counter for each variable; the problem is that I can't really show the grade of the diamond yet; but this would be trivial with just writing a number
  However; in which colour do I actually show the diamonds? I could easily mix those colours, but am not sure if I want that DONE
- merge; this is basically an extra if in the drag-drop check DONE
- buy DONE
- level up; this should be trivial DONE

- Have things light up for the different actions DONE

- Make the buttons clickable (I think this is not important for now; volunteers can do that)

6a might be same as above; maybe also add effects; monster waves
// No visual effects though; did I mean stuff like poison? That probably seems reasonable

6b music/sound

7 "polish"; disable level editor stuff in final build; show something before start and after end maybe
// I think I do not do that



//TODO(Tobi): I definitely want to add asserts in the code
